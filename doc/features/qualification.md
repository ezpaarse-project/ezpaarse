### EC qualification ###

The CEs are considered **qualified** when they present enough information to be useful. The qualification level is based on the presence of so-called **qualifying** fields, weighted according to their importance. A CE is considered qualified when the cumulative weight of its qualifying fields reaches a fixed threshold.
