### Access Events Qualification

The qualification level of an access event is based on the presence of so-called **qualifying** fields, weighted according to their importance.

An access event is considered **qualified** when the cumulative weight of its qualifying fields reaches a fixed threshold, ie when they possess enough information to be useful.
