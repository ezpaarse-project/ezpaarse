This library provides a readable stream that keeps reading until the\nfile has been idle for a certain time.\n\n## Current status\n\nThis module is still fresh. Try it while it's hot.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install growing-file\n\n## Usage\n\n    var file = GrowingFile.open('my-growing-file.dat');\n    file.pipe(<some writeable stream>);\n\n**Note:** The file does not have to exist yet when invoking this method. An\n`'error'` event is emitted if it is not created within the configured `timeout`.\n\n## Options\n\n`GrowingFile.create` accepts an `options` array.\n\n    var file = GrowingFile.open(path, options);\n\nWhere `options` defaults to:\n\n    {\n      timeout: 3000,\n      interval: 100,\n    }\n\nTime values are given in ms.\n\n* `timeout` determines after what time a file is considered to be done growing.\n* `interval` specifies the frequency at which the file is being polled for changes.\n\n## License\n\nWritten by Felix Geisendörfer, licensed under the MIT license.\n",
